-- CURRENT GAME MECHANICS
(Basic)
Platform collision and friction
Jump / Hold jump
Wall jump
Move right
Move left

(Unique)
"Colour Parkour" : jumping on platform makes last disappear and next appear
"Color Pulse" :    reveals "hidden" platforms that blend into background color

-- GAME OBJECTS
player
platforms



// TODO: in "challenge mode", do not set platforms to "hidden", just turn off
// collision. Their color will hide them.


BUGS/FIXES:
if you hold an input RIGHT after starting game before hitting ground, that input is
disabled. Possible fix: disable inputs until player is on ground for first time.

improve wall jumping and wall collision

remove motion trails if possible (NOTE: this is because of refresh rate / frame rate issues)



TODO:
- work on color filter ("stained glass") objects
  Define behavior: (a little more complicated)
    * land on top and player stops (just like top is a normal platform)
    * bottom of filter sits on a platform
    *

- level creation and transition (populating platform objects)
  Reset world involves: define resetplatforms (get rid of html objects), call levelgenerator
- title / menu screen
