-- CURRENT GAME MECHANICS
(Basic)
Platform collision and friction
Jump / Hold jump
Wall jump
Move right
Move left

(Unique)
"Colour Parkour" : jumping on platform makes last disappear and next appear
"Color Pulse" :    reveals "hidden" platforms that blend into background color

-- GAME OBJECTS
player
platforms

// TODO: in "challenge mode", do not set platforms to "hidden", just turn off
// collision. Their color will hide them.

// TODO: REEALLY should lock viewport screen size if I can; all calculations done in
// pixels so viewport size directly affects the physics (max, max jump height, accel, etc.)
// Pretty good values:    outer/inner Width: 1160,      outer/inner Height: 967/904

BUGS/FIXES:
if you hold an input RIGHT after starting game before hitting ground, that input is
disabled. Possible fix: disable inputs until player is on ground for first time.

improve wall jumping and wall collision

remove motion trails if possible
